Vyomchara  
May 2023 formed 
Nand Nagri, North East Delhi, registered office 

Initial 2 years
Mines visit and understanding Indian specific problems of mines 
50 + mines visit: Tata, MOIL, Vedana, Orissa MC, Gujarat mines GMDC, HZL, Indian oil Assam
Understanding the niche field with indian context 
Parallel product building 
Current → Piloting focused 

Pain points → Our solutions and finding 
Resistance to Tech adoption → Multi stakeholder approach
Workers → main driver of mines because they do the real extraction work, loose their rights to clean environment, + added tension of Job chala jayega 
Eg: they dont wear tracker which is for their safety, ki maalik ko location pata chal jayega aur woh danda karega 
Managers → worker kaam nahi karenge, adopted traditional approach
Contractors → chori ruk jayega, main source of extra income, sab kamate hai 
Even with the Top executive and bureaucratic orders, adoption is very slow. They just make plans without understanding the why part.
We have to start implementing from the bottom to gain confidence first.
Thats why pilot in Mines just for showing benifits without taking money or cut directly from the beneficiary mines, bottom up approach  

Lack of integrated solution → Mining 4.0 platform
No company is providing all inclusive solution 
Fragmented solutions → headache of management for mines official when they are already overloaded with social problems of workers, compliance management 
Any extra work, even digitalisation seems headache to them 

Remote location/ limited infra → on-premises solutions with their existing (infra+delta)
Foreign company can never reach the remotest location of Indian mines
Can never understand indian mining problem and stakeholders
So even if they want to reach the mines, they are not able to reach there till now, and will never be 

Cost sensitivity → partnership ecosystem  
Modular solution tailored for industry specific need 
End to end single enterprise software solution 
Indian team and company, maintenance is very easy
5-10x less price from the industry standards companies like Hexagon, Dassault, Sandwik, Reactore

After successful pilot, whole OMC mines will be using this software, easy 10 cr+ revenue in subsequent/within 1-2 years after project completion+ expansion as only company to make a mines Digital 
I’ll take care that commercialisation rights is given to Vyomchara
This is DoT+DST funded project, any mines in India going for digital translation will come under Vyomchara through maybe TEXMiN for initial stage, but subsequently commercialisation rights ka mai sort karwa lunga that it happens through Vyomchara
Coal India (open cast) → if success in 1 year which i’ll take care of, we can get whole Jharkhand and Orissa coal mine of Coal India Limited
Asset Maintenance, Planning and Scheduling Solution 
Production Planning and Scheduling Solution 
Future - Replacing legacy software like Minex  Surpac for mine planning through Indian software (Low Hanging Fruit). Right now, this project is just analysis on taking base outputs of these software 
Coal India is looking for companies to make this software for adopting across Indian Mines (bureaucratic order)
Minex base code is with us now :) for some level of understanding the software on which dassult built minex
Lets say in pilot we are getting 10/20 lacks for building POC, and after getting exclusive commercial license (i’ll take care of this shit, it will come to Vyomchara), 
10 lacks per license * 500 mines will be our minimum revenue after a year or so + maintenance cost
If these 2 pilot are successful, in 5-10 years, every mine is going to adopt some digitalisation. And every mine’s 1st preference is IIT ISM, from union ministry to state ministry, and 5G DoT is only going to give project to TEXMiN, and we are the only company here doing this shit. I’ll make sure ki other company ki maa mai chodu for real, have been doing this shit for the last 2 years.
We do not have, but our partners do, so we can/have to integrate it into our platform in the future, very much doable

Things will take time, paisa bhi hai but in long term and recurring paisa hai 

Our strategic placement → Dhanbad, hub for mining, 

Very important point because of IIT Bombay (Prof and govt focused) presentation
There are only 4 TTRPs by Indian government for focusing in tech translation in key areas for country growth 
Technology Translation Research Park
innovation hubs for deep-tech startups	
C3i hub, IIT Kanpur → Cybersecurity
IISc Bangalore → Robotics
