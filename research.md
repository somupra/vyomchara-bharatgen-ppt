## 2. Core Problem Statement in Mining

*   **Lack of Integrated End-to-End Technological Solution:** This is the central challenge. The difficulty arises from:
    *   Multiple stakeholders with conflicting interests.
    *   A significant lack of existing technology infrastructure at remote sites.
*   **Resistance to Technology:** Strong status quo and potential job displacement create friction.
*   **Remote Operations & Infrastructure:**
    *   Limited infrastructure is a major barrier.
    *   **Our approach:** Focus on the quality of infrastructure, not just the volume. A single Voxel machine per site can be a starting point.
*   **Cost Sensitivity:** High costs for advanced equipment are a major deterrent for adoption.

## 3. Proposed Solution: Vyomchara Platform

*   **Vision:** A system integrator providing a "Mining 4.0" platform for planning, research, and drone infrastructure.
*   **Hardware Product ("Voxel"):**
    *   A portable, drone-mountable device for hyperspectral analysis of minerals.
    *   **Functionality:** Grade detection, ore detection (e.g., for Iron ore).
    *   **Technology:**
        *   CNC-machined metal body.
        *   Outsourced (not white-labeled) high-quality cameras.
        *   Aims to be a cost-effective alternative to expensive, non-portable systems.
    *   **Potential IP:** Design patent for the integrated system.
*   **Software & AI:**
    *   **VOXEL Software:**
        *   **Machine Control:** IoT-based controls (ESP32).
        *   **AI Model:** Fusion of Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for precise mineral location.
    *   **Mining 4.0 Dashboard:**
        *   **Inspiration:** Modeled after Reactore's "Mine One" dashboard.
        *   **Features:** Automation, insights, operations management, and reporting. Integrates with partner solutions.
*   **Data Acquisition Methods:**
    *   **Non-Destructive:** Drones (magnetometer, hyperspectral), satellites, IoT sensors.
    *   **Destructive:** Analysis of drill core samples.
