What about the name, need some formal doc on whatsapp where company is registered [harsh]
Logo png/svg on whatsapp HQ (maybe animated, no pressure if not)
Maybe reverse engineer design style from sample bharat gen winners from last year, do research 10 mins [somu]




[premise]
Research about mines, research about stratas, research about mining operations
Business case studies, adani, vedanta, check what infra currently exists
Mines are of many types -
Underground mines
Opencast mines 
Eg. wind planning [core problem statement]
Panigrihi for mine ventilation planning 
Resistance to Technological Adaption
Status quo is strong, jobs exist, end to solutions don’t exist
End to end -> what are two ends?
Operation chain -> auction -> production -> delivery
Auction → company get mines → [underlying research to start operations]
Planning 
Topological mineral captivity -> we might also enter ideation phase for the govt where the operations aren’t even decided, auctioning is also not decided, but we are basically flagging that minerals exist here and we provide tech solutions to basically enhance the case studies needed on a geopolitical and demographic level so as to convince govt that mining in a certain field is better than letting it be.
Exploration 
Destructive – Drill core (1m cylinder)
X ray: olympus x ray [case study, somu]
magnetic susceptibility 
Spectrography
                                                                            
Non Destructive → 
Drone mapping → magnetometer, hyperspcectral camera, radars
satellite hyperspectral etc 
Case study: https://www.geotek.co.uk/products/boxscan/
Drill core + non destructive inputs -> check for patent
System integrator -> design patent, read doc [somu]
Vyomchara product -> voxel 
Does hyperspectral analysis of the minerals
Iron ore -> grade detection, ore detection
Design patent? [harsh]
Hardware parts: CNC [metal] + camera [outsourced NOT whitelabelled] → [harsh] → major cost bottleneck → resistance to cheap chinese cameras
Boxscan gives 4cr camera → funding issues here → real cost of the machine is 22 cr → full non destructive system → in india only used in research in ONE institute
No portability issues
VOXEL software:
Machine control: iot movements and data collection boards, ESP32, camera is drone mountable, so saves cost and increases portability of the machine.
AI model: 
Spectral angle mapper can identify granular minerals, 
CNN → minimum size or block of mineral, 
Intersection of SAM+CNN → where is the mineral 
Dispatch

Multiple profs, advisors at ministry levels doing budgeting since it’s a tender and not a one time funding
Bureaucratic chain -> can plan to provide AI automation (like RAFTAAR) for them to speed up the process
Think about jobs, friction, adaption
Research -> privately owned -> faster, much autonomous
Vyomchara -> gives out platforms for planning, research and drone infra
Civil operations are privately owned and controlled, assuming that bills and plans have to be casted inside govt to get funding in parts and operation once is running then sustains on profit sharing
Needs metrics to check what is the ROI increase via tech to tangibly decide how much should be split bw the two parties
Consultancy model -> B2B 
Tender model -> B2G (g is govt)
  
Lack of Integrated end-to-end Technological Solution
Why is this hard?
Multiple stakeholders, lack of tech infra
No indian firms in competition:
Hexagon, reactore, sandwik
Stryos -> some level some part
IITK company → AEREO → was a drone company before, now getting into mines and shit 
Remote Location with limited infrastructure
We discard volume of infra from the quality of it → one voxel machine per site 
Camera
Chinese: siyi A8 mini Full HD 6X zoom camera ₹30000, stable feed
Adti: digital camera, 20 MP, ₹50000
RPI camera: normal surveillance, video stream, ₹200-₹3000
PTZ: 1.5 lacks 10X digital zoom, 
Lidar: Velodyne puck, 5 lacks
Chinese: Tarot, Siyi camera: up to 2 lacks
Drone 
Quadcopter → 1.6 lacks, optional camera mounting, 600 gm payload, 35 mins 
Hexacopter → 3.2 lacks (10 litres), 4.5 lacks (16 litres)    
for heavy payload 3kg, 25 mins
to 10kg (7-8 mins)
VTOL → (3.5 lacks) large area quick mapping
120 mins, 600 gm 
Mapping setup → DGPS centimetre-level accurate maps, 3.5 lacks
Cost sensitivity


Resistance → Multi stakeholder approach → workers, managers, contractors
Lack of integrated solution → Mining 4.0 platform
Remote location/ limited infra → on-premises solutions with their existing (infra+delta)
Cost sensitivity → partnership ecosystem
